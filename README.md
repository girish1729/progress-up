## What is this?

This is a HTML5 multiple files Upload plugin with progress bar
indicator.

This uses the HTTP XHR messages to show continuous progress.

Images are also previewed in a gallery.

## Why should you care?

If you allow multiple large files upload then a progress indicator is a
cool way to give user feedback.
